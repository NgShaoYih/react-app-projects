# react-app-projects
all my react projects from university.

## Assignment 1 - Translink Data Parser
A terminal-based Node.js application, the program gathers data from the Translink API and flters it to only display buses from UQ Lakes station at a certain time. Following the functional programing paradigm of recursion, the program is made fully without loops. 

## Assignment 2 - Songtrax
A React web based application built using React Web & dependencies. The application is a music sharing app similar to PokemonGo, where users can share music based on location. The songs are saved to each individual student's server by calling an API, essentially a CRUD application but with the added caveat of displaying by location.
